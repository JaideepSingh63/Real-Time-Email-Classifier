# 📧 Real-Time Email Classifier

A machine learning–powered system that classifies incoming emails in real time into categories such as **Spam**, **Important**, and **General** using **NLP preprocessing**, **TF-IDF feature extraction**, and **Scikit-Learn models**.  
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end ML pipeline — from data cleaning to real-time predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time email text classification  
- Spam / Non-spam / Category-based filtering  
- NLP preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, regex cleaning  
- TF-IDF vectorization for numeric text features  
- Multiple ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)  
- Confusion matrix, accuracy, precision & recall  
- Modular and production-ready code structure

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Email text is collected (real-time input or dataset)  
2. Text is cleaned using NLP preprocessing  
3. TF-IDF converts text into numerical feature vectors  
4. The trained ML model predicts the category  
5. The final label is displayed instantly
